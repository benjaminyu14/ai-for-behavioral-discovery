bee scripts I wrote at WINLAB 2024. The project uses ML to determine whether insects behave differently in the prescence of a magnetic field. Simulation data was used to diagnose model behaviors and reducing Model shortcut learning. Background subtraction was used on real insect video data to remove noise and diagnose lighting issues.
